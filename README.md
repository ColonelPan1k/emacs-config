# Emacs

This is my daily config for Emacs. I spend the majority of my time working in
emacs and need it to be well-suited to everything I do.
I recenlty did a major overhaul using org-mode and org-babel. Using this,
it's much easer to keep organized and much more literate.

I've decided that the main thing I use on any linux distro is emacs and
don't configure enough outside of emacs to have any other dotfiles. The
whole goal of my emacs config is to make everything accessable through
emacs and not need any outisde applications.

Much of my config is inspired by the config files of [Harry R. Schwartz](https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles/blob/main/emacs/dot-emacs.d/configuration.org)
and [David Wilson](https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org)).
